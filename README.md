# Introduction to LLM Models

## Overview

This repository contains resources, experiments, and code related to Leetcode problem-solving, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs). It is designed as a learning and experimentation space for understanding and building modern AI models.

## Features

- **Leetcode Solutions:** Scripts and notebooks for solving algorithmic problems.
- **Deep Learning Experiments:** Implementations and tests with neural network architectures.
- **LLM Exploration:** Code and notes for building, fine-tuning, or analyzing Large Language Models.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive notebooks for tutorials and experiments.
- **MIT Licensed:** Open for academic and personal use.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Recommended: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- (Add any other dependencies as needed)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dabster108/Leetcode-DeepLearning-LlM.git
   cd Leetcode-DeepLearning-LlM
   ```
2. **(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

- Explore the `notebooks/` directory for interactive tutorials and experiments.
- Run scripts from the `src/` directory for model training, evaluation, or data processing.
- (Add specific usage examples as your project evolves.)
