'''AI-Powered Career Path Planner for High School & College Students

Problem Statement

In many developing regions (and even globally), students struggle to decide:

What career path suits their skills and interests?

Which academic subjects to choose?

What job matches their personality and marks?

Guidance counselors are often unavailable or inconsistent, so this system will fill that gap with data-driven AI.

 Objective

Build a web-based or app-based system that:

Asks users questions about their interests, academic marks, and soft skills.

Uses clustering to group the user with similar past students.

Uses classification to predict a suitable domain (e.g., tech, health, law, etc.).

Uses a recommendation engine to suggest relevant careers, courses, and scholarships.

Uses search techniques to match descriptions from student input to job fields.

 AI Techniques from Your Syllabus Covered

Course Topic	Where It's Used
Classification	Predict best-fit career domain (e.g., Engineering, Medical, Law)
Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes	Used to classify career fit based on input
KNN Algorithm	Used for nearest neighbor matching with past students
Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)	Group users into clusters based on skill and interest patterns
Recommendation Systems	Suggest courses, colleges, scholarships based on user cluster
Collaborative Filtering	Recommend careers based on similar profiles
Search Techniques	Match keywords from user profile with job descriptions
Regression	Estimate potential income/progression over time per career
Confusion Matrix, CV, Bias-Variance	Evaluate your classification models
Apriori Algorithm (Optional)	Find associations between subjects (e.g., "CS + Math â†’ Data Science")

 Data You Can Use
